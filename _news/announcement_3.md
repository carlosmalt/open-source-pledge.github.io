The committee met for the second time to move forward with a *minimum viable product* approach. We were inspired by  [Data Science 4 Everyone's Commitments Directory](https://www.datascience4everyone.org/commitments-directory). In this approach, organizations make free-form commitments that are publicly viewable on the directory. The public nature of the commitment provides a soft form of accountability that won't get stuck in administrative red tape like something more legally binding might. The central registry of commitments allows for relevant communities to discover those commitments, fosters collabortion, and helps avoid duplicative efforts. 

Based on those discussions we decided to move forward with an initial registry. We considered various technical implementations, and decided to investigate the use of GitHub pages as a platform that would allow for collaborative contributions to the registry as was a mechanism for [feedback](/open-source-pledge/feedback/) through  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cranmer/open-source-pledge/issues) and 
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cranmer/open-source-pledge/discussions/). That led to the creation of this site, which, at the time of this writing, is just an exploratory effort.
