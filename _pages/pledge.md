This is a work in progress. The plan is to collect commitments through GitHub as simple Markdown files per organization. We may also try to provide a form to collect this information for those that are not comfortable with GitHub.

Options:
  * [Submit a pull request to the repo](https://github.com/open-source-pledge/open-source-pledge.github.io) 
    * more detailed instructions to follow
  * fill out a form
  * contact us via email

  Once you've made a pledge, proudly display the badge   [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/open_source-pledge-darkturquoise)](https://open-source-pledge.github.io)
 on your website with a link to your commitment. Here's the code in Markdown:
