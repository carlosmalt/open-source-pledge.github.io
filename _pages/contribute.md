This is a work in progress. The plan is to collect commitments through GitHub as simple Markdown files per organization. We may also try to provide a form to collect this information for those that are not comfortable with GitHub.

Options:
  * [Submit a pull request to the repo](https://github.com/cranmer/open-source-pledge/) 
    * more detailed instructions to follow
  * fill out a form
  * contact us via email
