The committee met for the first time to learn the background of the initiative, review the scope and timeline, and to begin sharing perspectives and ideas. The primary topics were:
 * what is the goal of the pledge
 * what is the incentive for academic units to make the pledge
 * what are examples of commitments that would be impactful to the open source community
 * how do we think about accountability
 * how do we ensure that the pledge is not exclusionary
 * how will we collect feedback and iterate / evolve from the initial approach
 * how does this initiative interact with other related efforts in this space
 
 We also reviewed an initial list of potential activities that organizations might make as commitments, which was developed in collaboration with Arliss Collins, NumFOCUS's developer advocate.
